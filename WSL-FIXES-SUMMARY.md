# WSL Setup Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve WSL setup issues in the RX-DEX project. The original WSL configuration was using nginx placeholders instead of actual Rust services, which prevented proper functionality when running in WSL with Kali Linux.

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Docker Compose Configuration**: The WSL docker-compose file (`docker-compose.wsl.yml`) was using nginx placeholders instead of actual service Dockerfiles
2. **Missing Services**: Several services like admin-service, trading-service, and indexer were not included in the WSL docker-compose file
3. **Inconsistent Configuration**: The WSL docker-compose file was not consistent with the main docker-compose file
4. **Incomplete Documentation**: The WSL README needed updates to reflect the correct usage patterns

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Docker Compose WSL File (`rx-dex/docker-compose.wsl.yml`)
- Replaced nginx placeholders with actual service Dockerfiles
- Added missing services (admin-service, trading-service, indexer)
- Configured proper environment variables and dependencies
- Ensured consistency with the main docker-compose file
- Maintained WSL-specific optimizations

### 2. WSL README (`rx-dex/WSL-README.md`)
- Updated with comprehensive instructions for both direct cargo execution and Docker Compose
- Added detailed service port information
- Included troubleshooting section
- Provided clear development workflow guidance
- Added testing instructions

### 3. Test Script (`rx-dex/scripts/test-wsl-setup.sh`)
- Enhanced to check Docker connectivity
- Added validation for Docker Compose files
- Improved error reporting and guidance
- Added clear next steps for successful setup

### 4. Main README (`rx-dex/README.md`)
- Added reference to WSL fixes
- Updated WSL section with improved instructions

## Key Improvements

### 1. Two Development Options
Users can now choose between:
- **Direct Cargo Execution**: Faster development cycles with automatic reloading
- **Docker Compose**: Production-like environment with container isolation

### 2. Complete Service Coverage
All services are now properly configured:
- API Gateway
- Quoter Service
- Order Service
- User Service
- Matching Engine
- Wallet Service
- Notification Service
- Admin Service
- Trading Service
- Indexer Service
- Web Frontend

### 3. Proper Dependencies
All services now have correct:
- Environment variables
- Dependency declarations
- Port mappings
- Volume configurations

## Service Ports

| Service | Port | Access URL |
|---------|------|------------|
| API Gateway | 8080 | http://localhost:8080 |
| Quoter | 8081 | http://localhost:8081 |
| Web Frontend | 8082 | http://localhost:8082 |
| Order Service | 8083 | http://localhost:8083 |
| User Service | 8084 | http://localhost:8084 |
| Matching Engine | 8085 | http://localhost:8085 |
| Wallet Service | 8086 | http://localhost:8086 |
| Notification Service | 8087 | http://localhost:8087 |
| Admin Service | 8088 | http://localhost:8088 |
| Trading Service | 8089 | http://localhost:8089 |
| Indexer Service | 8090 | http://localhost:8090 |

## Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Cargo Execution (Recommended for Development)

1. Start services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/daily-dev-wsl.sh
   ```

2. In another terminal, start the web frontend:
   ```bash
   cd clients/web
   trunk serve --port 8082
   ```

3. Stop services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop-daily-dev-wsl.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Recommended for Testing)

1. Start services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.wsl.yml up --build
   ```

2. Stop services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.wsl.yml down
   ```

## Verification

Run the setup verification script:
```bash
./scripts/test-wsl-setup.sh
```

This will check:
- WSL environment
- Required tools (rustc, cargo, trunk, docker, wrk)
- Project files
- Script permissions
- Docker connectivity
- Docker Compose file validity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running on Windows
   - Check Docker Desktop settings to expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375
   - Verify network connectivity between WSL and Docker Desktop

2. **Service Not Responding**:
   - Check logs in `/tmp/` directory (for direct cargo execution)
   - Use `docker-compose logs` (for Docker Compose)
   - Verify all dependencies are running (Redis, PostgreSQL)

3. **Rust/Cargo Issues**:
   - Ensure Rust is properly installed: `rustc --version`
   - Verify cargo tools are installed: `cargo --version`, `trunk --version`
   - Check that the wasm32 target is installed: `rustup target list --installed`

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Reliable WSL Setup**: Users can now successfully run RX-DEX in WSL with Kali Linux
2. **Flexible Development Options**: Choice between fast development cycles and production-like environments
3. **Complete Service Coverage**: All services are properly configured and available
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions for setup, usage, and troubleshooting
5. **Automated Verification**: Test script to validate setup and provide guidance

These fixes ensure that the RX-DEX platform can be reliably developed and tested in WSL with Kali Linux, providing a seamless development experience for users on Windows systems.
