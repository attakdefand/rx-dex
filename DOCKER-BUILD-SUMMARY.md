# Docker Build Summary

This document summarizes the status of Docker builds for the RX-DEX project after implementing fixes for edition 2024 compatibility issues.

## Successful Builds

The following services build successfully with Rust 1.82:

1. **quoter** - Simple quote service
2. **api-gateway** - Main API gateway
3. **user-service** - User management service
4. **wallet-service** - Wallet management service
5. **notification-service** - Notification service
6. **admin-service** - Administrative service
7. **indexer** - Blockchain indexer service

These services use our custom workspace configuration (`Cargo.docker.toml`) that excludes edition 2024 crates and dependencies that require edition 2024 features.

## Failed Builds

The following services fail to build due to dependency issues with the `base64ct` crate requiring edition 2024:

1. **order-service** - Order management service
2. **matching-engine** - Order matching engine
3. **trading-service** - Trading service
4. **web** - Web frontend service

### Root Cause

The `base64ct` crate version 1.8.0 in the crates.io registry requires edition 2024, which is not fully supported even in Rust 1.82. This affects services with complex dependency chains that pull in this crate.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Custom Workspace Configuration**: Created `Cargo.docker.toml` that excludes edition 2024 crates
2. **Updated Rust Version**: Upgraded all Dockerfiles to use Rust 1.82
3. **Selective Building**: Successfully built simpler services while identifying problematic ones

### Future Work

1. **Dependency Version Pinning**: Pin versions of problematic dependencies to compatible versions
2. **Nightly Rust**: Consider using nightly Rust builds for full edition 2024 support
3. **Dependency Audit**: Audit and update dependencies to avoid edition 2024 requirements
4. **Alternative Crates**: Find alternative crates that don't require edition 2024

## Recommendations

1. Continue using the custom workspace configuration for Docker builds
2. Monitor the stabilization of edition 2024 features in Rust
3. Gradually update dependencies as they become compatible with stable Rust versions
4. Consider separating complex services into their own build processes with specific dependency management
