# RX-DEX Docker Build Status

This document provides an overview of the current Docker build status for the RX-DEX project.

## Current Status

We have successfully resolved Docker build issues for 7 out of 11 services by implementing a combination of approaches:

1. **Custom Workspace Configuration**: Created `Cargo.docker.toml` that excludes edition 2024 crates
2. **Updated Rust Version**: Upgraded all Dockerfiles to use Rust 1.82
3. **Selective Building**: Created scripts to build only working services

## Working Services

The following services build and run successfully:

1. **quoter** - Simple quote service
2. **api-gateway** - Main API gateway
3. **user-service** - User management service
4. **wallet-service** - Wallet management service
5. **notification-service** - Notification service
6. **admin-service** - Administrative service
7. **indexer** - Blockchain indexer service

You can build these services using:
```bash
docker-compose build quoter
docker-compose build api-gateway
docker-compose build user-service
docker-compose build wallet-service
docker-compose build notification-service
docker-compose build admin-service
docker-compose build indexer
```

Or use our convenience scripts:
- `build-working-services.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `build-working-services.ps1` (Windows)

## Services with Issues

The following services still have dependency issues related to edition 2024:

1. **order-service** - Order management service
2. **matching-engine** - Order matching engine
3. **trading-service** - Trading service
4. **web** - Web frontend service

These services fail to build due to the `base64ct` crate version 1.8.0 requiring edition 2024 features.

## Solutions Implemented

### Custom Workspace Configuration
We created `Cargo.docker.toml` which is a copy of the main `Cargo.toml` but without the edition 2024 crates in the workspace members list.

### Dockerfile Updates
All service Dockerfiles were updated to:
1. Use Rust 1.82 which fully supports edition 2024 and meets dependency requirements
2. Copy the workspace files
3. Replace the workspace configuration with our custom `Cargo.docker.toml`
4. Build the service with the cleaned workspace

## Next Steps

1. **Dependency Version Pinning**: Pin versions of problematic dependencies to compatible versions
2. **Nightly Rust**: Consider using nightly Rust builds for full edition 2024 support
3. **Dependency Audit**: Audit and update dependencies to avoid edition 2024 requirements
4. **Alternative Crates**: Find alternative crates that don't require edition 2024

## Scripts

We've provided convenience scripts to build only the working services:
- `build-working-services.sh` - Bash script for Linux/macOS
- `build-working-services.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows
