   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rx-dex
   ```

2. Start the complete DEX:
   - On Linux/Mac: `./scripts/start-dex.sh`
   - On Windows: Run `scripts/start-dex.bat` or `scripts/start-dex.ps1`

3. Access the DEX:
   - Web Interface: http://localhost:8082
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080

### Testing
- Run the test scripts to verify all services are working
- Check the logs if any service fails to start

## Architecture Overview

The complete DEX consists of 10 microservices:

1. **API Gateway** - Entry point for all client requests
2. **Trading Service** - Core trading functionality
3. **Quoter Service** - Price quoting
4. **User Service** - User management
5. **Order Service** - Order management
6. **Matching Engine** - Order matching
7. **Wallet Service** - Asset management
8. **Notification Service** - User notifications
9. **Admin Service** - Administrative functions
10. **Web Frontend** - User interface

All services communicate through the API gateway, which provides a unified interface for clients.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Real-time WebSocket connections for live updates
- Advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit, etc.)
- Mobile application
- Advanced charting and technical analysis
- Multi-language support
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Advanced admin features (user banning, system configuration)
