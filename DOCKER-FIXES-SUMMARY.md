# Docker Build Fixes Summary

## Problem
Docker builds were failing with the error:
```
error: failed to parse manifest at `/usr/local/cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/base64ct-1.8.0/Cargo.toml`
Caused by:
  feature `edition2024` is required
```

## Root Cause
Some dependencies (specifically base64ct v1.8.0) required edition 2024 features that weren't fully supported by our Rust version, even Rust 1.82.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Dockerfiles to use latest Rust
Changed Dockerfiles to use `rust:latest` instead of specific versions to ensure we have the latest Rust features including full edition 2024 support.

### 2. Downgraded dependencies
In `libs/dex-primitives/Cargo.toml`, downgraded:
- `cosmwasm-std` from version "2" to "1"
- `ed25519-zebra` from version "4.1" to "3.0"

### 3. Fixed compilation error
Fixed a move/borrow error in `services/matching-engine/src/main.rs` by cloning values properly.

## Services Successfully Built
- matching-engine
- quoter
- user-service
- wallet-service

## Next Steps
Continue building remaining services and test the complete DEX platform.
